**Abstract:**

GrillTech is an innovative web application designed to enhance the dining experience by seamlessly blending technology with culinary excellence. Developed using PHP for backend functionality and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, GrillTech offers a user-friendly interface that allows customers to explore a variety of grilled dishes, customize their orders, and enjoy a seamless dining experience. The application leverages modern web technologies to provide a responsive platform, optimized for both desktop and mobile users. GrillTech not only serves delicious meals but also integrates smart features such as real-time order tracking, menu recommendations, and user reviews, ensuring a dynamic and interactive dining experience. With its combination of sleek design and efficient functionality, GrillTech redefines the way customers engage with their favorite grill-based cuisine.

**Problem Statement:**

In the current digital age, many restaurants still rely on traditional methods for managing orders, menus, and customer interactions. This results in inefficiencies, delays, and limited engagement between the restaurant and its customers. Specifically, for grill-based restaurants, providing a seamless and interactive experience that allows customers to easily explore, customize, and track their orders can be a challenge. 

The absence of a modern, tech-driven solution hinders customer satisfaction, reduces operational efficiency, and misses out on opportunities for personalization and real-time feedback. 

GrillTech aims to address these challenges by offering a web-based platform that streamlines the dining process, enhances customer interaction, and provides a more personalized and efficient experience for both customers and restaurant staff. By integrating smart features like real-time order tracking, customized menu options, and responsive design, GrillTech seeks to transform the way customers engage with grill-based dining establishments.


**Existing System:**

In the current system, most grill restaurants operate through traditional methods such as physical menus, paper-based order taking, and manual tracking of customer orders. Customers often face difficulties in customizing their orders, and there is limited or no interaction with the restaurant’s operations through a digital platform. The process is usually time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks personalization. Additionally, wait times can be longer as staff manually process and manage orders. Some restaurants may have basic online ordering systems, but they often lack real-time updates, menu customization, and modern features that enhance customer engagement and experience.

**Drawbacks of the Existing System:**
- Limited customer interaction with the menu (no customization or real-time recommendations).
- Long wait times due to manual order taking and processing.
- Potential for errors in order fulfillment due to communication gaps between customers and staff.
- No real-time tracking of orders, which can lead to dissatisfaction.
- Inconsistent user experience across different devices (e.g., desktop vs. mobile).
